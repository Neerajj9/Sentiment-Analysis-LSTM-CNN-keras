# Sentiment-Analysis-LSTM-CNN-keras
A simple Sentiment Analysis of Movie reviews (IMBD) with two different approaches  of LSTM and CNN.

1 .
The first approach is of Recurrent Neural Networks with LSTM to introduce a memory element for decision making .
It could be further improved by using a Bidirectional LSTM model woth pretrained Word Vectors or Embeddings such as Word2Vec or Glove 

2 .The second approach uses Convolutional Neural Networks and considers all parts of the given sentence seperately while classifying 
into a Sentiment . It can be improved by further hyperparameter tuning and adding of Regularisation and Pooling.
